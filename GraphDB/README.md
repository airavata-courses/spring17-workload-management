##Neo4J GraphDB

I am currently converting this to Maven project. 
We need to download and install the Neo4J software from here: https://neo4j.com/download/community-edition/

Install all the required libraries as mentioned below:
* Goto https://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/  
* Click on "Neo4j 3.1.1 (zip)"   
* Extract this zip file into your required file system path   
* Open "lib" folder to observe all Neo4j binaries.   
* Create a User Library to add Neo4j Libraries to the Java project
